# Deterministic Path Finding Algorithm Playground

* This project contains an enviroment for testing out and exploring various different pathfinding algorithms that we can apply to Nethack.

* The main file is [./main.py](./main.py)

* The enviroment code is in [./env.py](./env.py)

* The `AraStrategy` class is where we will put the logic for the `ARA` path finding algorithm.

* We can create other strategy classes for other pathfinding algorithims in the future.
